Dashboard for Android and Wear OS
Track bits of information on your phone and watch.
<br />

- Do you need a glanceable dashboard to track arbitrary data?
- Good.

- Do you hate to check every week when the next F1 race starts in your timezone?
- Me too.

Good news: This app will track data morsels like this.
Bad news: You have to make the data provider. But it's easy.

The data format as follows:

{
  "title": "Is it XMAS?",
  "message": "No"
}

To add a new card to the dashboard create a link for your service by replacing the "https" protocol by "dashlet":
